# ProductivityPlanter
Android app created for Hack The North 2018

## Inspiration
As grade 11 and grade 12 students, procrastination is something that is very familiar to us. In order to combat this weakness, we decided to create an application that incites the user to stay productive using growth incentive. By creating your own garden full of flowers and by being rewarded with a flower every time you achieve a goal, users would be encouraged to make better time management decisions. 

## What it does
The application creates a list of all the processes done by a computer (i.e. specific programs that were gone on such as the mail app or the iTunes app). It also records the duration of time spent on a specific program/process. Using this information, the program outputs suggests goals based on how much time is wasted on each program. If a certain goal is met, a flower is added to the garden.

## How we built it
The program was coded in Javan using the Eclipse IDE. A combination of JFrame and JPannel were used to display our graphics. We also used the ActionListener interface and the ActionEvent method with the graphic interfaces. 

## Challenges we ran into
Some challenges we encountered were as follows: 
- Thinking of an idea
- Finding a way to organize large data lists

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We were quite happy that we managed to use JFrame and JPannel to create a fully functional graphic display for the user. By being aware of the importance of color, button size, and graphics, we managed to make an application that is appeasing to look at. 

## What we learned
This product helped us to realize the true importance of idea generation and the planning process. Collaboration and communication were other key aspects that we now realize is critical to the formation and development of any working project. We also learned how to manipulate array lists and learned that there is not simply just one way of doing things. For example, Android Studio would also have been an amazing fit with our idea.

## What's next for ProductivityPlanter
We hope to eventually have our application be remade using android studio, as it would be even more acccessible on a phone interface. We also aim to include different colors/types of flowers for different goals being met. There should be rarer flowers awarded if a monumental goal was surpassed.
